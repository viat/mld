mld - Matchlist Analyzer Daemon
===============================

###Usage

mld is a background daemon. So you just have to start the executable like this:

    ./mld
    
However, mld is expecting a configuration file at _/etc/viat/mld.conf_. You can also specify the configuration file directly by passing it:

    ./mld mld.conf
